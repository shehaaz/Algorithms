Algorithms
==========

Algorithms in Java.

1. Graphs
 	* Java Tree Example 

2. Searching
	* linearSearch
	* binarySearch
	* twoSum e.g: Input: {2,7,11,1} 18 -> Output: [2,3]
	* Fibonacci Recursively/Dynamic Programming

3. Sorting
	* bubbleSort	 	

4. String Manipulation
  * reverseString
  * Find the longest palindrome in a String (Recursively)

## Controlling Access to Members of a Class

#LinkedList
* Arrays disadvantage: in an un-ordered array searching is slow and in an ordered array insertion is slow. Deletion is slow for un-ordered and ordered arrays. Also, the size of the array can't be changed after it's created.
* Linked List solves this problem.
* Linked Lists replace arrays as the basis structure for stacks and queues. That is why for the LRU Cache we use a linked list. If fact, you can use a linked list in many cases in which you would use an array, unless you need **frequent random access** to individual items using an index.

```java
class Link
{
 public int data;
 public Link next;
 
  public Link(int data)
  {
   this.data = data;
  }
}

class LinkList
{
 private Link head;
 
 public void LinkList()
 {
  head = null;
 }
 
 public  boolean isEmpty()
 {
  return (first==null);
 }
 
 public void insertFirst(int data)
 {
    Link newLink = new Link(data);	
    newLink.next = head;
    head = newLink;
 }
 
 public Link deleteFirst()
 {
  Link tmp = head;
  head = head.next;
  return tmp;
 }
 
 public Link find(int key)
 {
  Link current = null;
  if(!this.isEmpty())
  {
   current = this.head;
   while(current.data != key)
   {
    if(current.next == null)
      return null;
    else
     current = current.next;
   }
  return current;
  }
 }
 
 public Link delete(int key)
 {
   //previous and current have a reference to the Head
   Link previous = this.head;
   Link current = this.head;
   
   while(current.data != key)
   {
    if(current.next == null)
     return null;
    else
     previous = current;
     current = current.next;
   }
   
   //check if the one to be deleted was the head
   if(current.equals(head))
    this.head = head.next;
   else
    previous.next = current.next;
    
   //return removed Link
   return current; 
 }
} 
```



##Trees
* Provide both quick insertion and deletion of a linked list, and also the quick searching of an ordered array.
* A tree is actually an instance of a more general category called a graph
* No Cycles: For a collection of nodes and edges to be defined as a tree, there must be one (and only one!) path from the root to any other node
* Binary tree: every node can have at most two children
* A Binary Search Tree: A node's **left** child has key less than its parent, and **right** child must have a key greater than or equal to its parent.
* un-balanced trees: One side of the parent has more nodes than the other. For example, when a data-entry person arranges a stack of personnel files into order of ascending employee number before entering the data. When this happens, tree efficiency can be seriously degraded. What to do about it? A redâ€“black tree is a data structure which is a type of self-balancing binary search tree
