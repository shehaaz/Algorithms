Algorithms
==========

Algorithms in Java.

1. Graphs
 	* Java Tree Example 

2. Searching
	* linearSearch
	* binarySearch
	* twoSum e.g: Input: {2,7,11,1} 18 -> Output: [2,3]
	* Fibonacci Recursively/Dynamic Programming

3. Sorting
	* bubbleSort	 	

4. String Manipulation
  * reverseString
  * Find the longest palindrome in a String (Recursively)

## Controlling Access to Members of a Class

#LinkedList
* Arrays disadvantage: in an un-ordered array searching is slow and in an ordered array insertion is slow. Deletion is slow for un-ordered and ordered arrays. Also, the size of the array can't be changed after it's created.
* Linked List solves this problem.
* Linked Lists replace arrays as the basis structure for stacks and queues. That is why for the LRU Cache we use a linked list. If fact, you can use a linked list in many cases in which you would use an array, unless you need **frequent random access** to individual items using an index.

##Trees
* Provide both quick insertion and deletion of a linked list, and also the quick searching of an ordered array.
* A tree is actually an instance of a more general category called a graph
* No Cycles: For a collection of nodes and edges to be defined as a tree, there must be one (and only one!) path from the root to any other node
* Binary tree: every node can have at most two children
* A Binary Search Tree: A node's **left** child has key less than its parent, and **right** child must have a key greater than or equal to its parent.
* un-balanced trees: One side of the parent has more nodes than the other. For example, when a data-entry person arranges a stack of personnel files into order of ascending employee number before entering the data. When this happens, tree efficiency can be seriously degraded. What to do about it? A redâ€“black tree is a data structure which is a type of self-balancing binary search tree
