##Trees
* Provide both quick insertion and deletion of a linked list, and also the quick searching of an ordered array.
* A tree is actually an instance of a more general category called a graph
* No Cycles: For a collection of nodes and edges to be defined as a tree, there must be one (and only one!) path from the root to any other node
* Binary tree: every node can have at most two children
* A Binary Search Tree: A node's *left* child has key less than its parent, and *right* child must have a key greater than or equal to its parent.
* un-balanced trees: One side of the parent has more nodes than the other. For example, when a data-entry person arranges a stack of personnel files into order of ascending employee number before entering the data. When this happens, tree efficiency can be seriously degraded. What to do about it? A redâ€“black tree is a data structure which is a type of self-balancing binary search tree
